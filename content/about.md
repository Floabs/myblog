I use this site as a personal reference and to share structured writeups. Each entry captures the target, tools used, key steps, and takeaways so I can quickly look things up later.

I self-host everything on my own server with custom DNS and Nginx in front.

Identity and access are centralized through my own Authentik IdP. Some projects are protected behind it; if you would like access or more details, feel free to reach out at florian.aberger@gmail.com.
