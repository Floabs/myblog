### Common

### f.e

UNIX crypt(3)
- Crypt(3) is a traditional UNIX encryption system with a 56-bit key.

Traditional DES-based
- DES-based encryption uses the Data Encryption Standard algorithm to encrypt data.

bigcrypt
- Bigcrypt is an extension of traditional DES-based encryption. It uses a 128-bit key.

BSDI extended DES-based
- BSDI extended DES-based encryption is an extension of the traditional DES-based encryption and uses a 168-bit key.

FreeBSD MD5-based (Linux & Cisco)
- FreeBSD MD5-based encryption uses the MD5 algorithm to encrypt data with a 128-bit key.

OpenBSD Blowfish-based
- OpenBSD Blowfish-based encryption uses the Blowfish algorithm to encrypt data with a 448-bit key.

Kerberos/AFS
- Kerberos and AFS are authentication systems that use encryption to ensure secure entity communication.

Windows LM
- Windows LM encryption uses the Data Encryption Standard algorithm to encrypt data with a 56-bit key.

DES-based tripcodes
- DES-based tripcodes are used to authenticate users based on the Data Encryption Standard algorithm.

SHA-crypt hashes
- SHA-crypt hashes are used to encrypt data with a 256-bit key and are available in newer versions of Fedora and Ubuntu.

SHA-crypt and SUNMD5 hashes (Solaris)
- SHA-crypt and SUNMD5 hashes use the SHA-crypt and MD5 algorithms to encrypt data with a 256-bit key and are available in Solaris.
