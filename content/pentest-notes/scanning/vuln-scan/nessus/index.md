### Common Issues & Fixes
- `all ports open / closed 	 	disable Ping the remote host in Advcanced Settings (stop scan from using ICMP)`

- `sensitive Networks: 			adjust Performance Options -> max concurrent Checks per host`

- avooid scanning legacy systems (option to not scan pritners f.e.) 	in the rules.

- ALWAYS "safe checks" to not run DoS plugins. and inform that you are doing a check.

### Checking for Impact of Nessus

- `sudo apt install vnstat`

- Check  before running nessus scan:

- `sudo vnstat -l -i eth0`

- Check after running nessus scan:

- `sudo vnstat -l -i eth0`

- now we can compare number of bytes and packets transferred during a vuln scan.
