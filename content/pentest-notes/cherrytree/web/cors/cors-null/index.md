Whitelisted null origin value
The specification for the Origin header supports the value null. Browsers might send the value null im the Origin header in various unusual situations:

Cross-origin redirects.
- Requests from serialized data.
- Request using the file: protocol.
- Sandboxed cross-origin requests.

First create same script like in basic:

Pack it in an iframe:

sandbox = for permissions
	allow- form: mal-code is inside a form inside a script inside a webpage
	allow-scripts: cause obv. its a script
	allow-top-navigation: i change directiton when i load the page.
srcdoc= i send my code inside a document as maliciouse code. but we need html encoded to work
