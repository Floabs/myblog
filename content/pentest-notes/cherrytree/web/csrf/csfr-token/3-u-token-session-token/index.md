All that you need is to have a valid csfr token and the session token of the user u want to attack but they are not linked

Find your valid csfr token in broswer

Copy your valid CSFR token
Use it to change the email of a differernt session: (other account), test:

write script: although be careful, csfr tokens only valid once, so each time they get sent u need log in again and grab a fresh token
