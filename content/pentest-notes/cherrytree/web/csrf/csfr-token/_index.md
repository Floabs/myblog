Unique secret generated by server and shared with client:

Req. looks like this;

Has many implementation vulnerabilities: (open children notes for more)

1. Request Forgery -> using different Parameter
2. Simply removing token cause they only check when its actually present
3. CSRF where token is not tied to user session -> u can use any valid token(yours f.e.)
4. CSFR token is tiedd to a non-session cookiee -> Extra header which ties csfr token to a cookie but not necassarily the session cookie
5. CSRF Token and Cookie are the same and server jsut checks if identical.: Attack similar to 4 but you can “invent” a CSFRKey
