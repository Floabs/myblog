Problem: You can't access parts of a website, cause need f.e. admin permission Solution: Fetch it over a normal request that gets its data from an api endpoint.

### Change the stockApi to the localhost u want to request

What happens now is that the server fetches its own localhost/admin and returns us the content Sicne the request comes from the server itself and not from us theres no prob with access.
