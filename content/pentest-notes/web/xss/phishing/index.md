1. Set up a listener on your host.
2. Create a proper login form that posts to your IP.
3. Inject a simple login form after XSS is discovered. Remove fields you no longer need (for example, the injected XSS element) using DevTools (`Ctrl+Shift+C`).
4. Combine everything into a single payload.
5. Do not only listen; host a PHP handler to capture credentials. Save it in `tmp/tmpserver/index.php` and serve it:

```text
sudo php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```
