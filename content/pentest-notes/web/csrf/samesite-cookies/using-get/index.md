1. Often the page doesnt really care if its GET or POST request then u can bypass.

`2. Get not allowed - FRAMEWORK DEPENDEND are f.e. _method allowed:`
Symfony Framework f.e.: So first its using GET to actually send the cookie along but then within the request it performs a put request so it actully works.
